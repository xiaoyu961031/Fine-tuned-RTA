# Fine-Tuned Reverse Topological Approach for MOF Structure Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Fine-Tuned Reverse Topological Approach (RTA) for the prediction and design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). This repository contains the code and supporting data used to predict MOF structures based on topological and geometric constraints, enabling efficient exploration of the vast combinatorial design space of building units (BUs). Our methodology integrates precision engineering (PE) to streamline structure generation, reducing computational complexity by filtering infeasible topologies early in the process.

## Key features
Python scripts for implementing the RTA with integrated topological constraints.
Tools for pairing BUs, assigning geometric signatures, and performing topology-directed assembly.
Data preprocessing pipelines and algorithms for in-silico synthesis and MOF curation.

In addition to the code and data provided here, the full set of over 94,823 precision-engineered MOFs (PE-MOFs) generated through this approach is available for download on Zenodo, which you can access here. https://zenodo.org/uploads/11480898
